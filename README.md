# Atomic Force Microscopy
A high-resolution form of scanning probe microscopy that employs a sharp tip in a raster motion to measure and visualize materials at the atomic and nano scales. This overview will serve as an introduction to atomic force microscopy.
### **¿How does it work?**

It has three subsystems that separately perform: *sensing, detecting and positioning*.
>1. **Sensing** : the AFM sensor is called a cantilever and has a small, sharp tip near the free end. When sufficiently close to the sample, the tip is affected by forces at the sample surface. This causes the tip to move, which in turn causes the entire cantilever to bend.
>2. **Detecting** :  the cantilever bending, or deflection, is detected optically using a laser and photodetector (a device that converts light into an electrical signal).
>3. **Positioning** :  positioning hardware called piezo actuators is used to change the relative position between the cantilever and the sample in three dimensions.

The most common type of AFM measurement is creating images of spatial variations in a signal, especially of topography (height). Images are acquired using the positioners to scan the tip across the sample and detect a 2D map of data points. As well as providing 3D images, the quantitative data in topography measurements can be quickly analyzed to obtain figures of merit for process control or other comparisons.
Topography images enable the visualization of many natural and synthetic small-scale structures—RNA, hemimicelles, nanoparticles, transistors, and much more.
